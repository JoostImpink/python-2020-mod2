# Assignment 1


First install 'Anaconda'. This is a package that includes Python, a coding environment (named Jupyter) and other helpful things (text editor, commonly used packages). Jupyter allows you to organize/run Python code on your computer through a web page. 

### Installing Anaconda on Windows: See [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/) 

Step 8: I suggest to check the first checkbox ('Add Anaconda3 to my PATH variable'). This will allow you to run Python from any folder on your computer, and more easily install addons.

### Installing Anaconda on Mac: See [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)

 
# Tutorials to review

Make sure you have reviewed the following topics before starting to work on this assignment. 

Variables: [https://www.py4e.com/lessons/memory](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/memory)

Conditional execution: [https://www.py4e.com/lessons/logic](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/logic)

Functions: [https://www.py4e.com/lessons/functions](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/functions)

Loops: [https://www.py4e.com/lessons/loops](https://www.py4e.com/lessons/loops)


## Required

Write a Python program that asks for user input (ask the user to enter a number), and write a program that finds all the factors of that number. 

Your program should print the 'type' of the input, before and after converting it to a number. (See below for 'type' function.)

> Look at the following functions: ['type'](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_type.asp), ['int'](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp)

> The 'type' function will print the type of the variable (string, integer, etc). The 'int' function can convert text to an integer


Your program needs to reject the user's input if the user does not enter a number. See [https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_input.asp) for an example to get user input.

See [https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factors-all-tool.html](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/factors-all-tool.html) for a way to find the factors of a number. The main point here is that you need to have a loop from 1 to the number entered. 

> You need to think about how can you test if some division gives a round number or not.


Please submit your python code along with the output of the program. In Jupyter notebook, select 'File', 'Download as', 'html'. This will create a HTML file with all cells and output, that you can attach to an email.

# Use web resources

There are lots of resources on the web to help getting Python to do what you want. Use Google to search for queries like 'Python input number', or 'Python test for equality'.
